## Overview
`readme-doctor` scores your README on the sections teams expect (badges, quick start, usage, config, CI, security, contributing, license, ToC, roadmap, FAQ), prints suggestions, and can **auto-append** missing sections in a safe, idempotent way.

---

## Quick start

### CLI
```bash
# check (no changes)
npx readme-doctor check

# fail CI if score below 80
npx readme-doctor check --fail-below 80

# write missing sections (idempotent, adds markers)
npx readme-doctor fix
GitHub Action
yaml
Copy
Edit
name: README Doctor
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npx readme-doctor check --fail-below 80
Usage
Run against the README in the current repo (defaults to README.md):

bash
Copy
Edit
# Basic check
npx readme-doctor check

# Specify a different file
npx readme-doctor check --path DOCS.md

# Enforce minimum score (non-zero exit if below)
npx readme-doctor check --fail-below 90

# Auto-append missing sections between markers (no overwrite)
npx readme-doctor fix
What gets added on fix:

Sections are appended between markers like:
<!-- readme-doctor:start:SECTION --> … <!-- readme-doctor:end:SECTION -->

Re-running fix won’t duplicate sections.

Configuration
Create readme-doctor.config.json in the repo root (all fields optional):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "path": "README.md",
  "minScore": 80,
  "sections": {
    "title": true,
    "badges": true,
    "install": true,
    "quickstart": true,
    "usage": true,
    "config": true,
    "ci": true,
    "security": true,
    "license": true,
    "contributing": true,
    "toc": true,
    "roadmap": true,
    "faq": true,
    "altImages": true,
    "links": true
  }
}
CI
This repo includes a minimal CI workflow that runs the doctor on pushes/PRs:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: readme-doctor CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npx readme-doctor check --fail-below 80
Tip: make this check Required on your protected branches.

Security
See SECURITY.md for how to report vulnerabilities. No telemetry and no network calls: the CLI only reads your README and optional config.

Contributing
Contributions welcome! Please see CONTRIBUTING.md and follow the zero-dependency guideline (Node ≥ 18). If you add checks, document the scoring and include a template for fix.

Roadmap
 Score badge endpoint (shields-style) to display README score

 Link checker with per-section hints

 Language-specific install hints (npm/pip/brew/go)

 Auto-generate TOC if missing (optional)

FAQ
Does it overwrite my README?
No. check is read-only. fix appends curated sections at the end between markers and won’t duplicate content.

Can I turn sections off?
Yes—set sections.<name> to false in readme-doctor.config.json.

Why fail on CI?
Docs are part of DX. Failing below a threshold prevents regressions and keeps repos adoption-ready.

How do I add it to any repo quickly?
Add the CI step above and run npx readme-doctor fix once locally to scaffold missing sections.
